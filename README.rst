 Doctags
=========


This package provides helpers to write technical documentation of
source code: Documentation skeletons are generated from Semantic tags.

At the present time, the generated skeleton use Doxygen syntax for
C-like languages. But it is easy to change. Documenting a tag is done
by `doctags-document-current-tag`.

See cedet/srecode/document.el in Emacs library for a good alternative.
